# Connect 4 App
## Description
The general rule of Connect 4 is that each player takes turn dropping a disk into the grid and the first player to form a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row of 4 disks wins.

This Connect 4 app is written in Javascript using the React library to build the client-side and NodeJS for the server-side. Online game mode 
is added by utilising a NoSQL database (MongoDB) to store the game state between two players. The client then interacts with the server to update game state
as each player makes their move.

## Learning Objective
The objective of this project is to for me to practise:
- accessing and manipulating DOM elements to implement in-game components and mechanisms
- using HTTP request/response cycle to incorporate the turn-making mechanism between the two online players
- using React hooks such as useState, useEffect, useContext and useRef.
