Classic game of Connect 4 written using Javascript and React. 

In Connect 4, each player takes turn dropping a disk into the grid and the first player to form a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row of 4 disks wins.

The goal of this project is to help me practise CSS and using React hooks. 

To do list:
- formatting the display and rules modal.
- implement the dark theme.
- create a toggle button for the display modal.
